            </h1>
            <p className="px-10 py-2">
              We will try our best to confirm 100% of the orders but in an
              uncertain event if we are being not able to fulfil the order, we
              may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing
              address/phone number provided at the time the order was made.
              <br />
              In case the order is cancelled, 100% refund will be issued to the
              customer We reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in
              our sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or
              distributors.
              <br />
              We shall not be liable for delay or failure to perform our
              obligations under these Terms if such delay or failure is due to
              any cause or conditions beyond our reasonable anticipation or
              control Such causes or conditions shall include, without
              limitation, acts of God or of the public enemy, acts of any
              government or any authority or public body thereof in either their
              sovereign or contractual capacity, strikes, refusal or inability
              of a common carrier to provide communications capabilities (for
              example, but not limited to, internet services, email services,
              telephone and messaging services), shortages of labour, energy or
              materials, freight embargoes, delays in transportation, unusually
              severe weather, earthquake, flood, fire, notified epidemic
              resulting in lockdown of the area of Our offices, or resulting in
              the closure of our office(s) whether by the order of the
              authorities or as a matter of abundant caution on our part, valid
              court order, or any delay or failure to perform by any supplier or
              sub-contractor resulting from any of the above or other
              circumstances beyond our reasonable control and against which we
              could not reasonably have protected ourselves, such events
              constituting a condition of Force Majeure. We will attempt to
              notify you, on best-effort basis, at the earliest practicable
              time, identifying the Force Majeure event, the date of its
              occurrence and the tentative date up to which the Force Majeure
              event is expected to continue; however, such notification is not a
              necessary pre-condition to the event being identifiable as a Force
              Majeure event and the tentative date is not an assurance or
              binding on us, and is provided only as a goodwill gesture.
