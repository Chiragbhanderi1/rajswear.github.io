        <h1>Returning Goods</h1>
        <p>

          Us. You should send the Goods at the following address:
        </p>

        <p>
          We cannot be held responsible for Goods damaged or lost in return
          shipment. Therefore, We recommend an insured and trackable mail
          service. We are unable to issue a refund without actual receipt of the
          Goods or proof of received return delivery.
        </p>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold my-4">Gifts</h1>
        <p>
          If the Goods were marked as a gift when purchased and then shipped
          directly to you, You'll receive a gift credit for the value of your
          return. Once the returned product is received, a gift certificate will
          be mailed to You.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Goods weren't marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift
          giver had the Order shipped to themselves to give it to You later, We
          will send the refund to the gift giver.
